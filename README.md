👋 Hi, I’m @free302.
I worked as a full-time R&D engineer in the corporate lab.
The company manufactures `small optics device` used in optical communication systems.
I developed the `test & measurement system` which tests the optical characteristics of the manufactured devices.
I also developed the test data analyzing sw, data managing web application and many other sw tools.

I got a __Ph.D__ in physics(quantum optics) in 2012.

👀 These days I’m interested in mashine learning and block chain technology.
